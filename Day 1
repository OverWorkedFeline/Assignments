1. What is the difference between truncate, delete, drop?
DELETE : 1.Delete is a Data manipulation Language Command (DML).
         2.we can use DELETE to delete one tuple of a table.
         3.we can use WHERE command in DELETE.
         4.Slower than TRUNCATE
         5.Can be rolled back
         6.Does not remove the Tuple permanently
         
         Syntax:
         //without where clause -> removes all the records.
         DELETE FROM table_name;
         
         //with where clause -> removed specific records.
         DELETE FROM table_name WHERE conditions;
         
TRUNCATE : 1.TRUNCATE is a Data Defination Language Command (DDL).
           2.we can use it to delete all the tuples of the table.
           3.faster compared to delete.
           4.We cannot use WHERE command in TRUNCATE.
           5.Cannot be rolled back.
           6.Truncate removes the entire records.
           
           Syntax:
           //Remove all records
           TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
           
DROP: 1.DROP is a Data Defination Language Command (DDL).
      2.DROP command removes all records and indexes.
      3.we cannot roll back.
      
      Syntax:
      DROP TABLE table_name;
