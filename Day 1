1. What is the difference between truncate, delete, drop?
DELETE : 1.Delete is a Data manipulation Language Command (DML).
         2.we can use DELETE to delete one tuple of a table.
         3.we can use WHERE command in DELETE.
         4.Slower than TRUNCATE
         5.Can be rolled back
         6.Does not remove the Tuple permanently
         
         Syntax:
         //without where clause -> removes all the records.
         DELETE FROM table_name;
         
         //with where clause -> removed specific records.
         DELETE FROM table_name WHERE conditions;
         
TRUNCATE : 1.TRUNCATE is a Data Defination Language Command (DDL).
           2.we can use it to delete all the tuples of the table.
           3.faster compared to delete.
           4.We cannot use WHERE command in TRUNCATE.
           5.Cannot be rolled back.
           6.Truncate removes the entire records.
           
           Syntax:
           //Remove all records
           TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
           
DROP: 1.DROP is a Data Defination Language Command (DDL).
      2.DROP command removes all records and indexes.
      3.we cannot roll back.
      
      Syntax:
      DROP TABLE table_name;
      
2. What are alias in MySQL?
   Alias is used to give a name to a table or column. But this name is temporary. Created using AS keyword.
   few uses: 1.It is used to make the column names more readable
             2.An Alias only exist for that particular query
   for example : SELECT column_names FROM table_name AS table_alias_name;
                 SELECT Cust_id AS ID, Cust_name AS Customer FROM Customers; ----> Here the we have given alias/different name for cust_id column as ID.
                 
3. How do you display even rows of the any table?
   Using mod() function!
              select employee_id, first_name from employees where mod(employee_id, 2)=1;
              
              idea here is to take a column which has indexes and used mod function to filter it out

4. How can you remove duplicates from a table(distinct and other way)?
   Method 1 : Using INNER JOIN 
              Delete column_with_dublicates FROM table_name AS table_alias(T1) 
              INNER JOIN same_table_name as table_alias(T2) 
              WHERE T1.column_with_dublicates < T2.column_with_dublicates
   Method 2 : Creating another table without dublicates
              CREATE TABLE copy_of_source_table_name SELECT DISTINCT columns_which_you_want or * FROM source_table;
              
5. How you can find 5th max salary?(Do it by all 3 ways)
              
-- creating Employee table in Mysql
CREATE TABLE Employee (name varchar(10), salary int);

-- inserting sample data into Employee table
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES ('stan', 3000);
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES ('mahi', 4000);
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES ('avi', 3000);
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES ('atharv', 5000);
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES ('saurab', 7000);
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES ('pavan', 7000);
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES ('sumit', 7000);
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES ('ajay', 7000);

Way 1 : 
SELECT name, salary 
FROM Employee e1
WHERE N-1 = (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT salary) FROM Employee e2
WHERE e2.salary > e1.salary)

For 3rd Highest.

SELECT name, salary 
FROM Employee e1
WHERE 3 = (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT salary) FROM Employee e2
WHERE e2.salary > e1.salary)

way 2 : TOP KEYWORD

SELECT TOP 1 salary
FROM ( SELECT DISTINCT TOP N salary
FROM Employee
ORDER BY salary DESC) AS temp
ORDER BY salary

For Top 3

SELECT TOP 1 salary
FROM ( SELECT DISTINCT TOP 3 salary
FROM Employee
ORDER BY salary DESC) AS temp
ORDER BY salary
             
Way 3 : LIMIT KEYWORD

SELECT salary FROM Employee ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT N-1, 1
